# Evidence inputs

Authoritative API source: installed exact Zig 0.16.0 standard library, especially
`std/os/linux/IoUring.zig`, `std/Thread.zig`, `std/atomic.zig`, `std/c.zig`.
Protocol: immutable RFC 9110, RFC 9112 and RFC 6585, as pinned and scoped by
`../zigllmwiki/sources/http11-framing-and-limits.md` and `http-overload-refusal.md`.
URI grammar: [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html), published
January 2005; notably scheme case-insensitivity is separate from path semantics.

OS and design inputs already pinned in the wiki before implementation:

- [liburing manuals](https://github.com/axboe/liburing/tree/4cf73437863c2e492d2a1d0f24330f391c0f075b/man)
  for single-shot submission, terminal completions and separate cancellation.
- [Apple kqueue manual](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/f6217f891ac0bb64f3d375211650a4c1ff8ca1ea/bsd/man/man2/kqueue.2)
  for readiness, one-shot registrations and filters.
- [Microsoft AcceptEx contract](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sdk-api/blob/5f2625b6782d3e9c0df08756583c527a0a2872ca/sdk-api-src/content/mswsock/nf-mswsock-acceptex.md)
  for zero-data asynchronous accept and accepted-socket context updates.
- [Microsoft overlapped socket contract](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sdk-api/blob/5f2625b6782d3e9c0df08756583c527a0a2872ca/sdk-api-src/content/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsasend.md)
  for descriptor capture and payload lifetime.
- [Microsoft batched completion contract](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sdk-api/blob/5f2625b6782d3e9c0df08756583c527a0a2872ca/sdk-api-src/content/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getqueuedcompletionstatusex.md)
  for bounded dequeue arrays and separate per-operation errors.
- [Microsoft cancellation contract](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sdk-api/blob/5f2625b6782d3e9c0df08756583c527a0a2872ca/sdk-api-src/content/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-cancelioex.md)
  for cancellation requests that leave operation ownership outstanding.
- [Microsoft socket-close contract](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sdk-api/blob/5f2625b6782d3e9c0df08756583c527a0a2872ca/sdk-api-src/content/winsock/nf-winsock-closesocket.md)
  for terminal ownership and provider resources retained during background close.
- [TigerStyle](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/47aeb2212a255273dda508288412e537d11e4b7c/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md)
  for explicit limits, startup allocation, checked arithmetic and ownership assertions.
- [TechEmpower plaintext driver](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/57d92fbec6f8fd7431bc77326dd0484e60c96e20/toolset/test_types/plaintext/plaintext.py)
  for the plaintext validator and pipeline depth 16. The demo uses exactly
  `Hello, World!` (13 bytes), dynamic Date refreshed each second, and Server.
- [Zig 0.16 release notes](https://ziglang.org/download/0.16.0/release-notes.html#x86-Backend)
  explain the default x86 Debug backend. The new ELF linker/default backend
  distinction matters for Linux CRT compatibility; see the verification report.

This project begins as an experimental bounded HTTP/1.1 implementation. Source
inputs do not establish runtime or performance. Test reports name exact
commits, compiler, OS/kernel, commands, limits and unexercised paths.

Safety assertions stay enabled for both Debug correctness tests and ReleaseSafe
measurements. Function size/style cleanup, deterministic schedule/fault injection,
fairness under sustained high connection counts, external dynamic buffer release,
and full kernel/process resource accounting remain work; this is an applied
TigerStyle experiment, not a claim of complete TigerStyle conformance.

The first source-hashed native result is
[the MVP receipt](../reports/2026-09-05-mvp.md).
